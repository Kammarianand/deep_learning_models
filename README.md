# Deep-learning
  
## Overview
This project is a Python-based application developed for fun and to fine-tune skills in software development. It utilizes various modules including Streamlit and TensorFlow to create a web application with features such as text summarization, text translation, text classification, and context recognition within text.

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes text input into concise summaries.
- **Text Translation**: Translates text into different languages.
- **Text Classification**: Classifies text into predefined categories.
- **Context Recognition**: Identifies context within the provided text.


## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`
3. Access the application through the provided URL.

## Future Updates
- Additional features planned for future updates include:
  - Improved user interface.
  - Integration of advanced machine learning models for text analysis.
  - Support for real-time text processing.
  - Enhanced performance optimizations.
